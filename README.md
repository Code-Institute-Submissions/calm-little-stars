# Calm Little Stars

[View Site on GitHub Pages](https://jonburdon.github.io/calm-little-stars/)
---
A website to profile a business offering mindfulness classes for children. The site features a consistent presentation of key information
 related to mindfulness for children as well as video and audio so that activities can be experienced. Call to action buttons are visible 
 consistently, with the aim of ensuring people can easily sign up to classes when they are ready.
 An important point to note is that whilst most B2C sites experience impulse buying, user research indicates that when purchasing services for children's mental and
 spiritual health, many people wish to establish trust and check reputation before making a purchase for their children. This is addressed with a look that feels
  professional, informative whilst still being calm and soothing.
The primary goal of the site is to encourage users to subscribe / book classes.
