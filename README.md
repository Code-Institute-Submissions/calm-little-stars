# Calm Little Stars

[View Site on GitHub Pages](https://jonburdon.github.io/calm-little-stars/)
---
A website to profile a business offering mindfulness classes for children. The site features a consistent presentation of key information
 related to mindfulness for children as well as video and audio so that activities can be experienced. Call to action buttons are visible 
 consistently, with the aim of ensuring people can easily sign up to classes when they are ready.
 An important point to note is that whilst most B2C sites experience impulse buying, user research indicates that when purchasing services for children's mental and
 spiritual health, many people wish to establish trust and check reputation before making a purchase for their children. This is addressed with a look that feels
  professional, informative whilst still being calm and soothing.
The primary goal of the site is to encourage users to subscribe / book classes.

## Features

Each page features an identical navbar. The bar is fully responsive, collapsing on medium
screens and below. It includes a call to action button which is always visible.
Each active page is underlined in the navbar to create a reassuring navigation experience for the user.
Each page has an identical footer which includes the opportunity to sign up for a newsletter, and social media 
buttons which link to the Facebook and Twitter (these would be linked to business social media profiles if the site was to be deployed.)
Hero images are used throughout the site to grab attention and promote a positive emotional response, and also to communicate the nature of the service offered
(mindfulness classes for children.)


*Home Page*
The Home Page features a Hero Image beneath heading text and a call to action button. Content peeking is used to indicate there is more to read.
Key information to address user stories is then presented in a way which draws the reader down the page. Each section of compelling copy is accompanied
by a button, to allow the reader to read more. Copy is presented bellow, to the right or the left of the appropriate image on larger screens to create interest
and also establish and reinforce the visual concept of the rule of thirds which is established in the header area, and is used throughout the site. 
On small screen sizes, the compelling copy appears over the background images in a translucent box, still allowing the user to read it whilst introducing the ideally
of the calming activities which the business offers. The 'Benefits of Mindfulness' compelling copy section is reduced to two sections of content on medium screens
and then to one on small screens. This is to reduce visual clutter and minimise the amount of scrolling required on small screens. As each section of
this copy has equal semantic value, reducing the quantity displayed does not detract from the user experience.

*Benefits Page*
The page has a header and footer which are identical to the rest of the website, with a line beneath the active page in the header to provide reassurance
and aid navigation.

The compelling copy on this page follows the rule of thirds established on the Home Page. Hero Images are used to elicit a positive emotional response.
The page is completed with a video to explain more and encourage the user to reduce bounce rate. The video would also be more accessible to children who might
have less reading ability than adults but are still have a significant user story. Children spend a significant amount of time watching video online, and
so video was used to engage this user. A plain background was introduced behind the video to reduce visual clutter and encourage the user to focus on the video.

## Testing

### Testing protocol for each page

The following testing protocols were followed for each page on desktop, mobile, tablet and smart TV devices.

* *Navigation Bar*
1. Verify that each link is correctly hyperlinked to the appropriate page. During testing, the brand text was found to be incorrectly linked.
2. Verify that the menu item visited is signified as the active page.
3. Hover over and off the button in the menu to ensure hover behaviour is as expected.
4. Change the width of the browser to ensure the navbar collapses when expected.
5. Click on the navbar toggler icon to ensure the navbar menu opens as expected.
6. Verify that the text on the collapsed menu is clearly readbable and does not interfere with page content.
7. Hover over the brand text and verify the hover behaviour is as expected.
8. Hover over each link and verify that the hover behaviour is as expected.

* *Page content*
1. Resize the width of the browser and verify that the content resizes for different screen sizes as expected.
2. Verify that any content that should be hidden on smaller screen sizes is hidden on those screens.
